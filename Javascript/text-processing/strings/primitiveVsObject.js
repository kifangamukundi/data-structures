// A string primitive is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, either single or double quotes.

const strPrimitive = 'Hello, world!';

// String primitives are immutable, which means once a string primitive is created, it cannot be modified. 
// However, you can create a new string primitive from the original one using methods like concat(), slice(), substr(), etc.

// A string object is created by calling the String() constructor.

const strObject = new String('Hello, world!');

// String objects are mutable, 
// which means you can modify the value of a string object using its methods like charAt(), replace(), toLowerCase(), etc.

// JavaScript automatically converts string primitives to string objects when you call a method on a string primitive.

const strPrimitive2 = 'Hello, world!';
const strObject2 = strPrimitive.toUpperCase(); // The string primitive is automatically converted to a string object here

// Similarly, JavaScript automatically converts string objects to string primitives when necessary. 

const strObject3 = new String('Hello, world!');
const strPrimitive3 = strObject.valueOf(); // The string object is automatically converted to a string primitive here

// Both string primitives and string objects have access to the same methods and properties

// When a method is called on a string primitive, JavaScript automatically converts the string primitive to a string object and then applies the method. 
// Similarly, when a property is accessed on a string primitive, JavaScript automatically converts the string primitive to a string object and then accesses the property.

const strPrimitive4 = 'Hello, world!';

// The `toUpperCase()` method is called on the string primitive
const strUpperCase = strPrimitive.toUpperCase();

// The `length` property is accessed on the string primitive
const strLength = strPrimitive.length;

// In both cases, JavaScript automatically converts the string primitive to a string object and then applies the method or accesses the property.

// However, it's important to note that string primitives are immutable, which means that any method that modifies the string will return a new string, rather than modifying the original string. 
// This is different from string objects, which are mutable and can be modified directly.
