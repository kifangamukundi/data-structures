# Data Structures, Algorithms & LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my repository for Data Structures, Algorithms, and LeetCode solutions! This repo contains my personal solutions to various coding problems, along with implementations of essential data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my implementations of common data structures and algorithms, as well as solutions to coding challenges on LeetCode. It's meant to serve as a study guide, practice resource, or reference for anyone interested in learning and improving their problem-solving skills in competitive programming and software engineering interviews.

## How to Use

You can browse through the directories and find specific topics you're interested in:

-   **Algorithms**: Explore common algorithms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms.
-   **Data Structures**: Understand and implement various data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
-   **LeetCode Solutions**: Check out my solutions to problems on LeetCode, organized by topic or difficulty.

## Algorithms

This section includes common algorithm implementations, categorized by type:

-   **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
-   **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search, Depth First Search (DFS), Breadth First Search (BFS).
-   **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, Longest Common Subsequence, Knapsack Problem, etc.
-   **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm, etc.

Each algorithm is thoroughly explained with code, time complexity, and space complexity.

## Data Structures

This section covers common data structures and their operations:

-   **Arrays**: Array traversal, insertion, deletion, etc.
-   **Linked Lists**: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list, etc.
-   **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, binary search trees, etc.
-   **Graphs**: Adjacency list and matrix representation, traversal methods.

## LeetCode Solutions

My LeetCode solutions are organized by difficulty:

-   **Easy**: Problems that are simpler to understand and solve.
-   **Medium**: Problems with moderate complexity.
-   **Hard**: Advanced problems that require more thought and optimization.

Each solution includes:
