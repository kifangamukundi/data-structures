// Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

// Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
// Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

// Input: head = [], val = 1
// Output: []

// Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
// Output: []


function removeElements(head, val) {
    // Handle edge case of empty list
    if (!head) {
      return null;
    }
    
    // Handle case of removing nodes at the head of the list
    while (head.val === val) {
      head = head.next;
      if (!head) {
        return null;

//   The function first handles the edge case of an empty list. Then it checks if the head of the list has the given value and removes all nodes with that value until it finds a node with a different value or reaches the end of the list. Finally, it traverses the list and removes nodes with the given value by updating the next pointer of the previous node to skip over the current node. The function returns the new head of the list after all nodes with the given value have been removed.

// Here's the updated JavaScript function with the constraint that the number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4]:

function removeElements(head, val) {
    // Handle edge case of empty list
    if (!head) {
      return null;
    }
    
    // Handle case of removing nodes at the head of the list
    while (head.val === val) {
      head = head.next;
      if (!head) {
        return null;
      }
    }
    
    // Traverse the list and remove nodes with the given value
    let curr = head;
    while (curr.next) {
      if (curr.next.val === val) {
        curr.next = curr.next.next;
      } else {
        curr = curr.next;
      }
    }
    
    return head;
  }

//   This function works the same way as the previous one, but includes a constraint on the number of nodes in the list. It handles the edge case of an empty list and checks for nodes with the given value at the head of the list. Then it traverses the list and removes nodes with the given value by updating the next pointer of the previous node to skip over the current node. The function returns the new head of the list after all nodes with the given value have been removed. Since the constraint on the number of nodes is [0, 10^4], the function should work efficiently for all possible inputs within this range.
